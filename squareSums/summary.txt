4 can't be done because the next square is 9 and the biggest total we can get is 3+4 = 7
But for 5, 6, 7, 8 we can aim for 9 (or a smaller square)
But 2 can't make a square until 7 is in the list. 
And then that is the only partner for 2 until we get to 14
Call a number like 2 a single, they must be at the start or end of the array
So we can only have two of them to deal with
Too many singles: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 when working with list 1..7
Too many singles: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 when working with list 1..8
Too many singles: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 when working with list 1..9
Too many singles: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 when working with list 1..10
Too many singles: 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 when working with list 1..11
Too many singles: 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 when working with list 1..12
Too many singles: 2, 8, 9, 10, 11 when working with list 1..13
Too many singles: 8, 9, 10 when working with list 1..14
for 9..15 we aim for 16 but, for some numbers, 16 is the only target we can reach
The highest list with too many singles that I could find was:
Too many singles: 16, 17, 18 when working with list 1..18
These can only target 25
18 stays as a single until 31
